# Frontend Build Process

This document explains how to build and deploy the obfuscated frontend.

## 🔒 Security Features

The build process includes several security measures to protect your source code:

### JavaScript Obfuscation
- **Variable Renaming**: All variables and functions get renamed to unreadable names
- **Control Flow Flattening**: Code logic is flattened to make it harder to follow
- **String Array Encoding**: Strings are encoded and shuffled 
- **Dead Code Injection**: Fake code is injected to confuse reverse engineering
- **Debug Protection**: Anti-debugging measures prevent inspection
- **Self-Defending**: Code detects tampering attempts

### Additional Protections
- **CSS Minification**: Reduces file size and removes comments
- **Anti-Debugging**: Detects developer tools and disables right-click
- **Console Disabling**: Prevents console usage in production

## 📦 Build Commands

### Production Build (Obfuscated)
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a fully obfuscated, production-ready build in the `dist/` folder.

### Development Build (Minified Only)
```bash
npm run build:dev
```
This creates a minified but readable build for testing.

### Local Development
```bash
npm run serve
```
Serves the unobfuscated source files for development.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Automatic Deployment (GitHub Actions)
The repository is configured for automatic deployment:

1. **Push to main/master** triggers the build
2. **GitHub Actions** installs dependencies and runs `npm run build`
3. **Obfuscated files** from `dist/` are deployed to GitHub Pages
4. **Source code** remains hidden from users

### Manual Deployment
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Upload contents of `dist/` folder to your hosting provider
3. Configure your web server to serve `index.html` as the main file

## 🛠️ Build Configuration

### Obfuscation Settings
The build process uses aggressive obfuscation settings:

- **Identifier Names**: Hexadecimal (unreadable)
- **String Array**: Base64 encoded and shuffled
- **Control Flow**: 75% flattening threshold
- **Dead Code**: 40% injection rate
- **Debug Protection**: Enabled with 2-second intervals

### Anti-Debugging Features
Production builds include:

- **DevTools Detection**: Monitors window size changes
- **Right-Click Disabled**: Prevents context menu access
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Blocks F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, Ctrl+U
- **Console Clearing**: Automatically clears console output

## 📁 File Structure

```

├── src/                 # Source files (readable)
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── config.js
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── index.html
├── dist/                # Built files (obfuscated)
│   ├── app.min.js       # Heavily obfuscated
│   ├── config.min.js    # Heavily obfuscated
│   ├── styles.min.css   # Minified
│   └── index.html       # With anti-debug scripts
├── build.js             # Build configuration
└── package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- **Source Protection**: Original source files are never deployed
- **Reverse Engineering**: Obfuscation makes code analysis extremely difficult
- **Debug Prevention**: Multiple layers prevent inspection
- **No Source Maps**: No debugging information is included

### Performance Impact
- **Larger File Size**: Obfuscated code is ~3x larger than original
- **Slower Execution**: ~10-15% performance overhead from obfuscation
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works in all modern browsers

### Development Workflow
1. **Develop** using original source files
2. **Test** with `npm run build:dev` (readable but minified)
3. **Deploy** with `npm run build` (fully obfuscated)
4. **Never commit** the `dist/` folder to version control

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Ensure Node.js 16+ is installed
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Check for syntax errors in source files

### Obfuscation Too Aggressive
- Edit `build.js` and reduce obfuscation thresholds
- Use `npm run build:dev` for testing with less obfuscation

### Runtime Errors
- Test with `build:dev` first to isolate obfuscation issues
- Check browser console for any remaining error messages
- Verify all dependencies are properly included
